I am Katja, born and raised in Gorje - Slovenia, but currently living in Villach - Austria.
I am an electrical engineer working for chip vendor in the area of software.
Apart from that, I have lots of different interests, a major one would be outdoors sports, 
mainly climbing and all its variants. 
For the rest, I am not sure if it makes sense to try to list them all here, nevertheless this website shows some of them.

To be completely honest, I am not totally sure if I wanna write an 'About'-page to the anonymous internet visitors - you 
or what the purpose of this website should be in the first place.
On top of that, I am also being quite realistic, that after some while, I might not be disciplined enough to post updates regularly. 
(+uf kinda not confident & pessimistic words here, just perfect for an About-page :) ) 

However I will try my best and the website is anyways already up and running - it is right here, right now, so...

If you find anything on the website interesting, let me know and I'd be happy to connect.

If you'd like, signup for my newsletter (which I might or might not send out :), lets see)
