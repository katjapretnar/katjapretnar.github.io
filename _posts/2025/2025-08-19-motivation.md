What is the motivation behind creating this site?

There are actually more motivation points, so I will simply list them as following:
- I wanted to give a try to github pages. The motivation was to learn a bit about websites and to have more control over
the website (but not too much, so it still needs to be kept rather simple).
- I find an idea of having a blog or a personal website quite appealing.
One simple reason is the one that we probably share with all the geeky people out there  - to be able to make one in the 
first place. 

Another rather funny reason is that I have this Seinfeld scene in my head, where Kramer is yelling to George:

![Kramer yelling: You contribute nothing to society!](/images/2025/2025-08-19-kramer.jpg "You contribute nothing to society"){: .align-center}

so the site could be some place online where I could share some stuff/output/etc.

- My personal believe is that in today's age of AI generation it is more than ever important to create and realize ideas
that are completely grown out of humans' work. Even if that is way harder and even if the result is not that 
perfect/clean as if it would be if generated.

- I want to improve my drawing skills. It is something that I used to love to do, but as I grow to be an adult in a
modern society, I've completely neglected it.

- I want to share some ideas or places I have visited with others. That enables me to keep the memory alive for longer 
and digest the experience more thoroughly. And hopefully for the others it could serve as an inspiration as well.
