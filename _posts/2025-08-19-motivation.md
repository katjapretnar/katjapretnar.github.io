What is the motivation behind creating this site?

There are actually more motivation points, so I will simply list them as following:
- I wanted to give a try to github pages. The motivation was to learn a bit about websites and to have more control over
the website (but not too much, so it still needs to be kept rather simple).
- I find an idea of having a blog or a personal website quite appealing.
One simple reason is the one that we probably share with all the geeky people out there  - to be able to make one in the 
first place. 

Another rather funny reason is that I have this Seinfeld scene in my head, where Kramer is yelling to George:

![Kramer yelling: You contribute nothing to society!](/../images/2025-08-19-kramer.jpg "You contribute nothing to society"){: .align-center}

so the site would be some place online where one could share some stuff/output/etc.

- My personal believe is that in today's age of AI generation it is very important that people still use their brain and
their creativity to create real stuff.
