I am Katja, born and raised in Gorje - Slovenia, but currently living in Villach - Austria.
I am an electrical engineer working for chip vendor in the area of software.
Apart from that, I have lots of different interests, a major one would be outdoors sports, 
mainly climbing and all its variants. 
For the rest, I am not sure if it makes sense to try to list them all here, however this website shows some of them.

<sup><sub>
To be completely honest, I am not totally sure if I wanna even write an 'About'-page to the anonymous internet visitors - you -
or what the purpose of this website should be in the first place.
On top of that, I am also being quite realistic, that after a while, I might not be disciplined enough to post updates regularly.   
+uf kinda not confident & pessimistic words here, just perfect for an About-page :)

And since we - you and I - found ourselves here, lets try to make the best of it. I hope you enjoy this little piece of web.
