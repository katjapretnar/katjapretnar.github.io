What is the motivation behind creating this site?

There are actually more motivations, so I will simply list them as following:
- I wanted to give a try to github pages. The motivation was to learn a bit about websites and to have more control over the website (but not too much).
- I recenetly came across a book 'Share your work' or I even see a scene from Seinfeld where Kramer is yelling to George: "You contribute nothing to society!!!", so I find an idea of a blog perhaps as a place to 'output' something.
