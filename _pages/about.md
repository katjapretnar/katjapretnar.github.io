I am Katja, born and raised in Gorje - Slovenia, but currently living in Villach - Austria.
I am an electrical engineer working for chip vendor in the area of software.
Apart from that, I have lots of different interests, a major one would be outdoors sports, 
mainly climbing and all its variants.

I hope you enjoy this little piece of web. :sunflower:
